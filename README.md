# Isopropyl

Isopropyl is a JavaScript library that lets you use the same syntax on the client and the server to
fetch data. On the server, it directly accesses your data sources; on the client, it makes XHR calls
to an automatically-generated REST API. This isomorphic approach allows the developer to use one
convenient syntax regardless of where the code is executed.

**Coming soon.**
